# PythonLearning
My Python learning journey from basics to intermediate concepts with daily practice codes.
# Python Learning Journey (Day 1–Day 6)

This repository contains my Python learning practice from Day 1 to Day 6.
During this initial phase, I focused on understanding Python basics and core programming logic.
All practice code is currently written in a single Python file as part of my early learning stage.

## Topics Covered
- Python basics and syntax
- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Basic practice programs

## File Structure
  (Contains all practice code from Day 1 to Day 6)

## Tools Used
- Python
- VS Code
- jupyter(optional)
- GitHub

## Note
This repository reflects my beginner learning phase.
I plan to improve code organization and add more structured files as I continue learning.
